compare_module = "This module allows you to compare two Twitter accounts\
 to see who has the best statistics.\n\n-To do this enter the two people to be\
 compared.\n\n-You can enter additional parameters, including the number of\
 tweets to be considered (maximum 150) and wheter or not the search includes\
 replies.\n\n-Issues: It is possible that the search does not find a nickname\
 that exists on Twitter. This is the case if the person has not tweeted\
 enough (e.g.: search on 50 tweets and the person has only tweeted 5 times)\
 or if he is in private mode.\n\nAdditional info: It may take several seconds\
 to run the search, especially if you are searching on a large number of\
 tweets."

search_tweets_module = "This module allows you to search tweets by keyword, by\
 user or both.\n\n-There are several search options which are explained in the\
 bottom right window.\n\n-Issues: It is possible that the search does not\
 return anything. Make sure you have unchecked the 'Select User' option if you\
 have not entered a user name (or check that the user name is correct). If\
 this option is unchecked but the search does not return anything, it means\
 that no tweet in the last 30 days contains this keyword.\n\n-Information:\
 The searches for tweets are limited to the last 30 days by the Twitter API.\
 \n\n-Search on user name only: Enter a user's name without entering any\
 keywords."
