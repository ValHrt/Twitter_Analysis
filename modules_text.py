compare_module = "This module allows you to compare two Twitter accounts\
 to see who has the best statistics.\n\n-To do this enter the two people to be\
 compared.\n\n-You can enter additional parameters, including the number of\
 tweets to be considered (maximum 150) and wheter or not the search includes\
 replies.\n\n-Issues: It is possible that the search does not find a nickname\
 that exists on Twitter. This is the case if the person has not tweeted\
 enough (e.g.: search on 50 tweets and the person has only tweeted 5 times)\
 or if he is in private mode.\n\nAdditional info: It may take several seconds\
 to run the search, especially if you are searching on a large number of\
 tweets."
